        <p>Tired of buying groceries at crazy prices? So are we. That's why we decided to make Spark, so you can find the cheapest spot to shop -- by item. </p>
        <p> We make searching easy! All you have to do is type in your desired item in the search bar, choose your zipcode, and press submit! 
            Right now, we support searching all over Fairfax City, VA. </p>
        <p> Spark will search through all your local stores and compile a list of the cheapest matches. 
            From there, you can decide which item you want and add it to your shopping list. [example products can show up here] </p>
        <p> When you're done searching, you can head over to the Shopping List tab to review it. 
            Your list is organized by store, so you can get in and get out while getting the best possible price. [potential photo of the shopping list page filled out] </p>
